                Review:No movie is perfect, but ... I'll unabashedly say it's the best movie production I've seen in years
                Why? 
                3D works - and is a must - for this visually stunning, immersive experience. The CGI animation is seamlessly integrated into breathtaking scale and precise details, and the creativity of the scenes with the other-worldly life forms of Pandora set against the advanced technologies of the human sky-people is simply mind-blowing, leaving you to wonder "how the hell did they do that?"
                This epic masterpiece does need an intermission; however, as 3+ hours is a long pull; and yes, there are story line aspects that can be poked at ... nonetheless, if you want to see one memorable Holiday season movie, I'm giving this one

                ps - we are AMC A+ members so for $24/month (vs per movie!) we see up to 3 movies each week on any format, (IMAX, Dolby, 3D, etc), for no additional charge, and we can cancel on a monthly basis, so it's a good option to consider to stave off dreary winter days.

            Review:Cirkus has become a major tool of our daily work, and is of an higher importance in our internal production process then email communication. There are still lessons (and routines) to be learned and to get adapted by everyone, but I am very confident, that we will continue with our good experience. It's really cool to get in contact with the support team, who really try to help you or, if that spefic function is missing, write it on their feature request list and get back to you, when the feature is alive.
